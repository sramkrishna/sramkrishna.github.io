&lt;p&gt;Exploring the latest developments in AI-powered development tools and their impact on developer workflows, from code completion to automated testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="key-points"&gt;Key Points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community can provide scalability if we include them by creating assets in documentation and code samples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a library of code samples will allow AI to automatically be trained on it. With coding AI agents becoming popular we can provide them with training material for more accurate results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand for generative AI development is moving like a bullet train! Rapid
innovation can move lightning-fast and produce exciting projects. Now
is the time to embrace open development, refine best practices,
and collaborate on standards for all to benefit. This session will
outline common pain points involved in building LLM-based generative AI
applications, especially those using RAG techniques, and connect them
to open solutions. We will share reference architectures to help shorten
developers’ paths to releasing performant AI applications to meet the
needs of stakeholders and users. Finally, we’ll share community efforts,
such as the Linux Foundation’s Open Platform for Enterprise AI project,
to advance this critical work. Join us to explore ways to discover the
untapped potential in generative AI development workflows.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
