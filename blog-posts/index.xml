&lt;p&gt;This year, LAS will be held in Tirana, Albania and we are going all out this year to make it the best conference representing apps on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don't know or have not heard of Linux App Summit, the idea is to have desktops work together to help enable application developers to build apps on the Linux platform. It's a parallel effort to the Flathub and Snapstore app stores.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Linux App Summit 2025 – Call for Papers Open Now</title><link>https://portfolio.ramkrishna.me/blog-posts/2025-02-03-linux-app-summit-2025--call-for-papers-open-now-877ff598/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 05:15:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://portfolio.ramkrishna.me/blog-posts/2025-02-03-linux-app-summit-2025--call-for-papers-open-now-877ff598/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It’s that time again, and we are in our 7th year doing this conference (if you include LAS GNOME).

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to next year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my end-of-the year post as we all make our way into the New Year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've done quite a lot of things this year to help make oneAPI easier to use - a lot of the blog posts I've written as been towards an eye to educate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started off with some blog posts on how to use modern IDEs on Linux to write SYCL code and run them inside a container that we built, making a turn-key effort to build applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building oneAPI from Source</title><link>https://portfolio.ramkrishna.me/blog-posts/2023-12-22-building-oneapi-from-source-82f3ce93/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 06:08:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://portfolio.ramkrishna.me/blog-posts/2023-12-22-building-oneapi-from-source-82f3ce93/</guid><description>&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build oneAPI completely from git&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm back!! A few raw posts have been languishing and I decided the end of the year was the perfect time to put them out there. This will be one of three (hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to focus on how ￼to build oneAPI from git. This is somewhat of a return to my earlier blog post where I talked about how to build the DPC++ compiler and it included the binary versions of the openCL and level zero run time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Community Wiki</title><link>https://portfolio.ramkrishna.me/blog-posts/2023-09-30-community-wiki-a4dac5b3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Sep 2023 03:46:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://portfolio.ramkrishna.me/blog-posts/2023-09-30-community-wiki-a4dac5b3/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started a community wiki that everyone from all walks of backgrounds could help contribute and share their knowledge with others. This would be a great place to do tricks and tips, more concise documentation to do specific things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contribution is through the usual methods of either submitting a pull request. I’m willing to entertain giving folks priv access since a single person is not scalable. I’m certainly willing to give to folks who represent other architectures like Arm, RocM, Nvidia, RISC-V and so on. The wiki should be a resource for everyone. The only thing I ask is to follow the PR process regardless so that we can at least look over grammar and spelling for consistency sake.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>oneAPI moves to Unified Acceleration Foundation (UXL)</title><link>https://portfolio.ramkrishna.me/blog-posts/2023-09-30-oneapi-moves-to-unified-acceleration-foundation-u-be81e962/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Sep 2023 03:36:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://portfolio.ramkrishna.me/blog-posts/2023-09-30-oneapi-moves-to-unified-acceleration-foundation-u-be81e962/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As accelerators have become more prevalent in the industry there has been a bifurcation in the industry which typically resolves itself. Initially there has been many efforts by a myriad of vendors in the GPU accelerator space with various degrees of openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long period of time, incubation of the oneAPI ecosystem started at Intel through both DPC++ SYCL compiler, and the publishing of open specifications of oneAPI and their open source implementations. While the messaging around the specs were that they were open to all contributors – it could be hard to feel comfortable especially for competitors to enter spaces where the perception is that it isn’t a true neutral space. &lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>GUADEC 2022 – GUADALAJARA</title><link>https://portfolio.ramkrishna.me/blog-posts/2022-08-24-guadec-2022--guadalajara-ef08b29c/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 02:03:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://portfolio.ramkrishna.me/blog-posts/2022-08-24-guadec-2022--guadalajara-ef08b29c/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, I was fortunate enough to be able to attend GUADEC in Guadalajara.
